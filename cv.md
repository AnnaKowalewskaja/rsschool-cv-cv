## __Experience__
### While studying at the University, we studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, PHP, but these were only small basics. Then I started working as a software engineer and now I can try my skills on a real site _(no one sees it yet)_. I often take free courses on programming and working with image editors.
